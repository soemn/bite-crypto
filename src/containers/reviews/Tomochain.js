### Product
1. **Tomochain**
- Tomochain is the underlying blockchain which forms the backbone of the Tomo ecosystem. It’s aim is to be an open-source blockchain infrastructure framework that can process billions of financial transactions per day with near zero fees and almost instantaneous transaction confirmation.

- Tomochain is a side-chain on the Ethereum network with support for horizontal scaling by adding second-layer blockchains, and also allow for cross-chain atomic transfers. It aims to solve the scalability problems currently faced by the Ethereum network. Tomocoin will be the currency of this blockchain and used as block rewards for nodes. With a 2 second confirmation time, Tomochain would be able to process more transactions per second than Ethereum.

- Tomochain also supports smart contracts and allows for token issuance, and is fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. This means that new projects can choose to ICO and issue tokens on Tomochain, and existing projects can migrate onto Tomochain as well. We believe this will be an extremely attractive proposition for projects that need high throughput and low transaction fees.
Furthermore, the team has already built the first Tomo dApp, aptly named Tomoapp, to showcase the capabilities of its network. The Tomochain testnet is available at https://stats.TomoCoin.io/

- Tomochain will launch with a Proof of Authority(PoA) consensus, and has plans in place to switch to Masternode architecture some time in 2019.


2. **Tomoapp:**
- Tomoapp is decentralized knowledge sharing application on Tomochain with thousands of weekly users. It consists of an incentive system that motivates users to contribute and work together to build a efficient knowledge sharing network. Users are encouraged to ask questions and other users can choose to answer these questions, earning Tomocoins in the process. Furthermore, the team intends to have more advanced features in future, such as creating a video channel in the app and charging users to access the channel, or gifting Tomocoins to live streamers.  The Beta version is now available at TomoApp.com, Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

3. **Tomowallet:**
- Tomowallet is a secure and user-friendly wallet made by the team. It is designed for users of the Tomo network to store their Tomocoins, although it is also compatible with Ethereum and other coins and tokens. Users will be able to safely send TomoCoin, messages and other coins and tokens to friends and contacts via this wallet. There is also API integration enabled for 3rd party bots and applications. The wallet was designed with the idea of “bridging the gap between a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a mainstream user”, and their goal is to create an easy-to-use wallet that would increase the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies. A demo of the wallet can be found at https://wallet.tomocoin.io/

### Team
Core Members:
- Long Vuong, Founder & CEO
-- Co-founder and previous project lead of the successful NEM (New Economy Movement)

- Son Nguyen, CTO & Director of Engineering
-- Experienced and accomplished technical leader, founder of the Blockchain Developer group with more than 800 active developers.

##### Notable Advisors:

- Min Kim -  Head of biz dev, Bee Token
- Roger Lim - Director, Qlink Foundation
- Antoine C. Najjarin - Head of strategy & operations, Devery
- Hoang Nguyen - Co-founder & VP, WeTrust

We believe that the team’s top members are solid and have the necessary expertise to develop the project. The advisors are part of other projects which have been relatively successful as well, and should provide good guidance and connections for the Tomo team. The project has attracted notable investors such as NEO, which should further strengthen investor confidence in the project.


### Roadmap

Beta version of TomoApp has already been released on Q3 2017

Testnet of TomoChain is already completed on Q4 2017

Official release of TomoApp and TomoWallet on Q3 2018

Official release of TomoChain on Q4 2018

Tight but achievable roadmap as the products are already at the beta testing stage


### Positive

We like that there is already a working beta for each component of the Tomo ecosystem, and believe that Tomochain is a good solution for Ethereum’s scalability issues.
Tomochain’s masternodes(to be implemented in 2019) will incentivize the staking of coins, driving the value of Tomocoin up.
Experienced team members with an leader who was the co-founder and project-lead for the NEM project, which is currently one of the top 15 cryptocurrency by market cap.
They have gained interest from renowned parties such as NEO, which should help them in terms of getting partnerships, especially those on the NEO network
Considering the scope of the project and the pedigree of team members and advisors, the hardcap of this project is extremely low and token distribution is fairly reasonable. Tokens reserved for team are only 15%, with a 4 year vesting period. This shows that the team has faith in this project and are working for the long-term.

### Negative

POA consensus might lead to centralization of the network. However, we believe this will be mitigated as the team plans to switch to masternodes sometime in 2019. If they do manage to do this, we would view this as a positive, as the initial use of PoA consensus will help to prevent sybil attacks when the network has a relatively smaller number of users, and the switch to masternodes in future will allow for better decentralization when the network has grown.

There are concerns on the direction of TomoChain in the long run if Ethereum manages to succesfully solve its scaling problems via sharding/plasma. In such a scenario, Tomochain would have no advantage over Ethereum(in terms of transaction speed). The team would need to work hard to grow the Tomo ecosystem so as to differentiate itself from the Ethereum network if such a scenario does occur.

### Conclusion

We believe that this project is a good short term investment. As the Ethereum network currently faces congestion issues on a regular basis (especially during ICO periods), the Tomo ecosystem should prove to be a good solution that many projects and users would consider moving to. The experienced team, advisors and proof of a working product are good indicators that the project will be able to deliver as per their schedule. Considering the scope of the project, this project has a low hard cap and we believe it will do well.

As for the long term outlook, we are neutral on this project. There is little detail available regarding the future direction of Tomocoin as their roadmap is not very extensive. Furthermore, to ensure its long term success, Tomocoin needs to have its own unique and differentiating characteristics from the Ethereum network, so as to maintain its userbase.
