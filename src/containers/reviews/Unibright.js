## Project Summary
Unibright is an project aiming to **achieve business integration of blockchain technology** into existing businesses. With the recent mainstream media coverage of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, more companies are showing interest in the adoption of blockchain technologies.

However, many of these **existing companies are lacking in the specialized knowledge** required to code and deploy these technologies. Thus, Unibright aims to introduce a framework which allows for existing businesses to **integrate their ERP/IT systems with the blockchain**, which can be specifically **customized for individual businesses**, without the need for these businesses to have a blockchain developer.

The Unibright Framework consist of 4 components, **the Unibright Visual Workflow Designer, the Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager, the Unibright Explorer & the Unibright Connector**. The Unibright Framework will be powered by the Unibright tokens (UBT).

## Product
### 1. Unibright Visual Workflow Designer
Unibright Visual Workflow Designer gives business the ability to craft powerful Blockchain-based solutions with **no full time developer required**. It offers users easy-to-use **Business workflow templates**, which include an adaptable basic workflow and corresponding workflow tool set items. Users can choose the appropriate template for a business use case and **customise their own visual workflow**. The resulting workflow definition is blockchain independent, saved locally and **can be compiled to different blockchain platforms**.

### 2. Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager
The Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager is a tool to **generate, deploy and maintain Unibright conformant smart contracts**. After defining a specific workflow based on Unibright templates, users will be able to compile the workflow definition into a blockchain smart contract. Subsequently, the smart contract will then be deployed to its destined blockchain. Existing smart contracts can be updated to new revision and paused/terminated if needed.

### 3. Unibright Explorer
The Unibright Explorer **monitors the ongoing business process across all smart contracts and related systems**. It presents on- and off-chain data in an easy to understand dashboard by use case related Smart Queries. The user will be able to see all data and transaction flow of all their deployed, Unibright conformant smart contracts in one place. Recurring queries, composing information from different smart contracts will be be saved locally as query sets. Queries might be assembled to views and also contain conditions.

### 4. Unibright Connector
The Unibright Connector **connects existing IT landscape with different blockchains and smart contracts**, using automatically generated Smart Adapters. **Smart Adapters encapsulate communication technologies to different target platforms** (ERP systems or other blockchains) via different channels (RFC, REST, SOAP, WebServices, ...). Off-chain systems, like SAP ERP or SAP PI, can be connected to be part of blockchain based business integration. For example, programs residing in a SAP-System will be able to call functions in Unibright conformant smart contracts, using the standardized communication channels offered by the suitable Smart Adapter

## Team Members 
### Core Members:
**Marten Jung**
Founder, CEO & Head of Blockchain Development
- 20+ years of experience in business modelling and software engineering.
- Gap bridging middleware specialist, expert in SAP integration

**Stefan Schmidt**
CTO & Head of Software Architecture
- 20+ years of experience in business modelling and software engineering.

We believe that the teams top members are solid, most of them have **more than 20 years of relevant experience**. The advisors are also **experts in SAP system** which is currently one of the most widely used Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software in the market. Furthermore, many of the core team members were a **part of SPO Consulting GmbH, a SAP solutions company with a strong presence in Germany**. We believe this lends credence to the teams expertise and connections to push for the adoption of the Unibright framework.

## Roadmap

**Q1 2018:** 
- First working version of Unibright Connector to SAP integrating Ethereum blockchain. 
- Prototype version of Connector to .NET and JAVA connecting legacy system

**Q2 2018:** 
- First working version of Unibright Workflow Designer, Lifecycle Manager and Explorer for internal use with SAP and Ethereum Blockchains.

**Q3 2018:** 
- Providing more workflow templates and specific interfaces to the Workflow Designer. 
- Adding smart code generation for different blockchains.

**Q4 2018:** 
- Beta version of Workflow Designer, Lifecycle Manager Explorer and Unibright Connector. 
- Tests and Quality Assurance. 
- First pilot customers using Unibright Framework

**2019:**
- Tests and Quality Assurance for complete Production Readiness 
- Adding more templates and blockchains.

## Verdict
### Positive
- We like the practicality of the project. Unibright aims to integrate blockchain solution into existing ERP systems, allowing existing businesses to **continuing using their existing ERP system which they are familiar with and difficult for business to replace**.

- Team and advisors consist of **experienced developers and SAP experts** which shows that they are well verse in what they are planning to achieve.

- Unibright faces competitions from enterprise solutions blockchain projects, such as Stratis and SophiaTX, and other projects which offer easy smart contract development, such as etherparty. While there may be an overlap in the areas covered, we believe that there is a niche that can be filled by Unibright. **Unlike other enterprise solutions blockchain projects which aim to replace traditional solutions altogether, Unibright instead aims to coexist with them**.

- **The hardcap of this project is relatively low (15mil) and token distribution is extremely good**. Tokens reserved for team are only 6%, with a 1 year vesting period.

### Negative
- Currently this project has **yet to have any strong partnerships**. However this may be due to the fact that this project is still in its early stage. A point to note that the **parent company of unibright, SPO Consulting GmbH, has well known existing clients**, including Shell, Samsung, Unilever which may come on board once Unibright products are ready.

- Currently Unibright **does not not have any working product**, the 4 components of the Unibright framework are still at their alpha stage. **The scope of the project is also big**, a concern would be if they can deliver as per their roadmap with the current size of the team.

- **Token usage is rather average**. Outside of speculation, token prices will increase solely based on supply and demand. We believe this could be improved by implementing some kind of token burn mechanic.

## Conclusion
### Short Term: _**Good**_
- low hard cap with good token metrics
- Real world use case for existing businesses which can attract investors
- Team members and advisors with strong experiences in enterprise solutions

### Long Term: _**Neutral**_
- Success of the project relies on widespread adoption of Unibright framework, which may be difficult given the large amount of competitors in the current space.
- E.g. SAP SE, one of the largest enterprise solutions software company, is currently working on their own blockchain solution, SAP Leonardo.
- Unibright has to deliver what they have promised in their tight roadmap inorder to prove themselves and stand out in this competition.
