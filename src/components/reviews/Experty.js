      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div>
        Experty is a protocol that brings the “expert network” business onto the
        blockchain. It aims to connect experienced professionals to users for
        consulting purposes. <br />
        <br />Expert networks are companies that seek out professionals(aka
        knowledge providers) and link them up with people who are seeking
        advice(aka advice seeker) in that particular field of expertise. The
        expert network company then receives a small commission. <br />
        <br />Similar to all blockchain projects, Experty aims to utilise the
        decentralizing aspect of a blockchain to remove the traditional middle
        man. Knowledge seekers will then be able to connect with their knowledge
        provider directly without having to pay fees to any intermediary.<br />
        <br /> Moreover, Experty plans to integrate their business into
        available social media platform; knowledge providers will be able to
        share their Experty link directly on their social or professional media
        such as LinkedIn, email signature, or Twitter profile. Payments will
        also be made through a smart contract that directly links the knowledge
        provider with the knowledge seeker, so payment between the two parties
        will be near instant. <br />
        <br />Experty plans on having the following features:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Profiles:</strong> Users can input their profession, and a
            small paragraph as to what knowledge they can provide.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video and Voice Calls:</strong> Users will be able to share
            their information through a quick phone call or video call, and
            knowledge seekers will be charged a per-minute fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Messaging and Scheduling:</strong> Knowledge seekers and
            providers will be able to communicate either the best time for them
            to meet, or discuss as to what they’re looking for before getting
            into a paid call.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EXY Tokens:</strong> The main source of payment on the
            platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EXY Wallet:</strong> A soft-wallet on the website to hold
            EXY tokens.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The Experty app allows blockchain influencers, advisors, and developers,
        and companies to monetize their time and knowledge.<br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Blockchain Influencers</strong> – Influential individuals
            have the power to sway masses, set trends, and bring attention to
            promising blockchain projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blockchain YouTubers</strong> – Popular YouTubers, such as
            Omar Bham from Crypt0’s News, have large audiences wanting to
            contact them directly. Due to time restrictions, direct contact
            usually occurs through comment replies or live streams. Omar has
            expressed interest in using Experty to schedule consultations with
            those that want his direct attention. Integrating with our platform
            will allow Youtubers an additional income stream by charging for
            private calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advisors</strong> – Short consultations with successful
            business advisors can become a critical pivot point for many
            companies on all levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Developers</strong> – Talented developers are hard to find,
            and their skills are often needed for multiple projects. Experty
            allows them to easily get involved on new projects and be paid for
            their work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ICO HotlinesICOs</strong> have become very popular.
            Companies and associations such as Bitcoin Suisse and CryptoValley
            Association deal with huge amounts of requests every day. These
            organizations are interested in using Experty as a hotline, so that
            people can pay to talk with specific people within the
            organizations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paid Premium Support</strong> – It can be difficult for
            exchanges to handle the high volume of support requests they get.
            Instead of waiting, customers can skip the line and pay for premium
            support.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Competitors</h3>
        There is already an entrenched ecosystem of expert call companies such
        as GLG. These companies have a massive presence in the consulting
        industry and will be difficult to dislodge. However, Experty’s
        decentralized model does have significant advantages over the incumbent
        business model, so this lessens the competition risk somewhat.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Positives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Experty has a team that is well-versed on the programming and
            development side. Though their team may seem lacking on the
            marketing and business development areas, their connections with
            various social media influencers, coupled with Proof-of-Caring,
            should more than compensate for this weakness.
          </li>

          <li>
            Users can share their Experty contact information wherever they
            want, such as on forums, social media profiles, their websites, etc,
            without the need to rely on a marketplace. Through this, Experty can
            achieve greater market penetration by simply tapping into the large
            userbase of traditional and social media outlets.
          </li>

          <li>
            Experty has a compact road map, they already have the Alpha version
            of their main net app out and Beta version (Mobile & Webapp) will
            soon be out in Q1 2018 prior to their crowdsale. There will be new
            features to be incorporated into their app and the whole project is
            aimed to be completed by mid 2019.
          </li>

          <li>
            The project has a strong community, with over 7,000 active members
            (at the time of writing) in their telegram page. The Proof-of-Care
            scheme should also generate strong awareness for this project. As
            hardcap is only 9 million, we expect the project should fully sell
            out with unmet demand.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Negatives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Experty has a very young core team with low experience which may
            hinder the development of this project. On the other hand, they do
            have strong advisors for their business and technical side which
            could provide good guidance and make up for the lack of experience
            of the team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since there are already an abundant of expert call companies in the
            current market, it will be a big challenge for Experty to get a
            significant of the pie in this market. Nonetheless, Experty being
            the first blockchain solution in the market does pose to have an
            upperhand as compared to the existing expert call companies. As
            such, for this reason, we believe Experty still has great potential
            to gain a significant market share in a long run.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
        </h3>
        Overall we feel that this is a solid project worth investing in. Experty
        should be a great for short term investors. The relatively low hard cap
        of 9 million coupled with the amount of awareness generated by the
        Proof-of-Care scheme should create lots of demand and interest in
        Experty. For long term investors, it would be advisable to wait and see
        how Experty can grow and maintain their user base once the initial hype
        from the project wears off.
